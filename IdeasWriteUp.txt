One of our ideas is a website where you specify what type of weather you want to 
exprience and it finds the cheapest flight to a location meeting those weather conditions
within a specified time period. This would allow users to find a semi cost effective way
to get to the weather that they want. We would use a weather api to get local weather information about
various places. We would also use an api that serves flight data so we could find the cheapest
flights. We would also employ a database that hold user information like username and password
as well as any other important information. This way users could have accounts. They could
also sign in using a third party authentication.
