One of our ideas is a website where you specify what type of weather you want to 
exprience and it finds the cheapest flight to a location meeting those weather conditions
within a specified time period. This would allow users to find a somewhat cost effective way
to experience the weather that they want. We would use a weather API to get local weather information 
about various locations. We would also use an API that serves flight data so we could find the 
cheapest flights to the user's desired locations.  We would also employ a database that stores 
user information like usernames and passwords as well as any other important information. 
This way users could have accounts. They could also sign in using third party authentication.

Our second idea is a website that assists people with grocery shopping based on recipes.
The user can search for a recipe they want to make or input ingredients they currently have
and get a recipe that can be made with them or requires few additional items. The app would pull
from a recipe API to identify recipes matching the ingredients they input. Then, if any items
need to be purchased for the recipe, the website will both locate nearby grocery stores and do
price comparisons to find the nearest and cheapest option for each ingredient and/or the
sum of all ingredients needed. User ingredients could be stored in a database with the ability
to update/remove ingredients as they are changed or used up, along with usernames and passwords
(sign-in would occur through third party authentication) in order to save each user's ingredients
so they don't have to re-input everything each time.
